    <h5>Instructions: The buttons above shows the the amount of medals in each Olympic year and also are used
         As a controler for the interactive graphs.</h5>
    <h4>The objective of these visualization is to show how late women were included into the Summer Olympics but more importantly
        how women are still under represented in the Olympics as of 2008 games in Beijing. 
        
        Note on data construction: All gender comparison results were computed using a weighted average. What this means
        is that within each country the percentage of medals won by men and women was changed based on how many events
        each gender could win. For example if there were 50 Women events and 100 male events and a country won 5 male medals
        and 5 female medals. The result would not be 50% women and 50% men. It would be 33% men and 66% women as it is 
        harder for a countries womens team to win 5 medals versus the mens team. 
        
        Second Note: Total Medal counts are counted by actual medals. For instance in a 4x100m race it would be 4 medals not 1. The
        reason it was completed this way is that team sports require more resources of a country to put together. Therefore, for this
        example it was a good way to weight the difference between individual events and team events. 
         
         
    <h2 align = "center">Total medals each Gender can win in Summer Olympics per year</h2>
    <h4> The two graphs below show how women were included into the games over time. As you can see it was not until 
         1992 when the total amount of medals that could be won jumped up and it wasn't until the 1996 games in Atlanta 
         where the amount of total medals won was comparible to men. 
         
         Currently there is close to a 100 medal difference between women and men. The main differece is because of weight
         classes. For example in boxing there are 10 male weight classes and only 3 female. Also in sports like gymnastics 
         where there are 7 events to 4 events. 
         
         Note: there were no Olympics in 1940 and 1944 because of World War II. 
         
    <h3>Women</h3>
    <div id="wmedals" style ="height: 30%"></div>
    <h3>Men</h3>
    <div id="mmedals" style ="height: 30%"></div>
    <h2 align="center">Women medal win proportion by country size</h2>
    <h4>The graph shows how the percentage of medal count for women compared to men for each country each year. The size of the dots
    represent the size of total medal count for the country.  Therefore the bigger dots are the most winning teams such as USA, Russia and Great Britan.
    
    What this graph shows is that women elite participation in sport started with just a few winning countries and that pattern flows through time.
    Over time the amount of countries presenting strong women teams increases but even in 2008 it has not reached a normal distribution. As is shown in
    this graph in 2000, 2004 and 2008 the most winning teams have greater than 50% of medals won by women and the smaller teams more often than not 
    have men winning more of the medals. 
    
    If were to flip this graph verticaly we would say there is a "left" skew signifying that this is not a normal distribution. 
    If there was an even distribution in the Olympics in all countries. The largest teams would be around the 50% mark and the smaller 
    teams would be even on each side. This patern is evident every year of the Olympics and therefore shows a pattern that half of 
    countries do not present strong women teams. </h4>

       The following is ordered by highest medal count in the 2008 Olympics. The graphs show a year by year animation 
       of women in sport for each country. From the graphs you should see how new countries are more often composed of 
       winners that are men and that countries with lower medal counts usually have male medal winners.
